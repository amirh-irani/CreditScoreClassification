# CreditScoreClassification
 Use of Machine Learning for Classiffing the Credit Score of a Random Person at the End of a Certain Month

 As we know, each person may hold atleast one or more credit card for her/ his financial transactions. The reason is by using a credit card, they can postpone their payments for a certain but limited period of time, litterally make themselvs debtful, and then by repaying that debt, create themselvs a valuable credit history. 

 By building a credit history, a prson can gain some leverage over time, for some specific reasons, like mortgage, etc. 

 So it is important for not only a financial institution, but also each and every individual who owns credit card, to gain a standard or good score for the average amount of time they use their credit, and built this history in a good shape. 

This project is aimed to classify the score of each random person, based on different features they possess like age, income, number of bank accounts, number of credit cards, and so on and so forth.
